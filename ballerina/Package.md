## Overview

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/), an AI research organization focused on creating friendly AI for humanity, offers the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) to access its powerful AI models for tasks like natural language processing and image generation.

The `ballarinax/openai-images` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [Image related endpoints of OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create) providing access to the new DALL.E models developed by OpenAI for various image-related tasks.
